## Client

The toolkit has a command that will let you generate a client.

### Usage

To generate a client:

```
swagger generate client [http-url|filepath]
```

To then use the client with a HTTP transport:

```go
// put sample here
```


### Supported functionality

At this moment the client does not quite support authentication **yet**.
